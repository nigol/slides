# Repository for my presentations / slides

This repo contains slides I'm using during my presentations. Created with great help of [revealjs](https://revealjs.com/) - pretty cool tool for creating nice looking presentations in HTML. Give it a try!

Slides are in `slides/` folder. Every HTML file is one presentation. If you want to use it for presentation purposes, you need to copy corresponding HTML file into revealjs directory and open it in web browser - and you are set.
